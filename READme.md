How to run:
    make
    make shell

There is a issues with the comparsion (Or maybe the way I token stuff, maybe I didnt include everything and convert them to tokens). 
1. What regular expressions/tokens did you identify, and how does your program react to each
one.
I found stuff like "if/else...." as control and define them as 2. So in the tokens.txt, it will show as 2. I do all of that to everything that might exits in a .c file.

2. A brief description in your own words of how you implemented the Winnowing algorithm
    The generateShingles function takes a line of text as input and generates shingles of a specified length (SHINGLE_LENGTH). Shingles are overlapping sequences of words or characters. The hashShingles function calculates hash values for each shingle generated by the generateShingles function. For each line in the input file ("tokens.txt"):Generate shingles for the current line using generateShingles. Hash the shingles using hashShingles to obtain fingerprints.
Output the fingerprints for the current line.
3. The results of your analysis, including identifying any submissions found by the algorithm that
you believe may be plagiarism
